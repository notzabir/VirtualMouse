This Python project employs basic AI and ML techniques to create an assistant mouse using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI modules. Users can control their mouse pointer with hand movements, allowing for actions like selecting and left-clicking.

Features:
-
•	Hand Tracking: Uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand movements in real-time.
•	Gesture Recognition: Recognizes specific hand gestures, such as pinching between the index finger and thumb, to perform mouse actions.
•	Mouse Control: Utilizes PyAutoGUI to move the mouse pointer, select items, and perform left-click actions.

Installation:
-
•	Clone the git repository.
•	Install the three required dependency modules.

Usage:
-
•	Ensure your webcam (internal or external) is connected and facing you.
•	Ensure there are no obstacles obstructing your hand movements.
•	Perform specific gestures (e.g., pinch/kiss between index and thumb fingers).

Contributing:
-
Contributions are welcome! I am working on adding right-click functionality, improving smoothness, and enhancing the UI.
